    "summary": "This code is for testing the SequenceAgent in TensorFlow using tf_agents library. It defines a class SequenceAgentTest that inherits from SequenceAgentTestSetUp and includes a testAsTransitionType method. This method creates an agent, checks if its as_transition attribute is of type data_converter.AsHalfTransition, and asserts it to be true. The code also includes licensing information and main function to run the tests.",
